## Game-Object Data Modules
These modules are concerned with how the game object data (a creature's hitpoints, or a sword's hardness) are defined, manipulated, and used.

### Parser
The Parser module accepts an infix expression (as a string) and produces a callable object (formula) which, when called, evaluates the expression (returning either a single value or a tuple of values).
