#Unit Testing Template
##TODO
This section contains four subsections; each subsection contains a todo list of tests we have yet to implement.
###Core Tests
* Core tests are for core functionality; they test correct outputs for certain inputs.
* They may also test methods that a class is expected to provide, though not methods that are primarily for internal use by the class.

###Joint Tests
* Joint tests are for overlapping modules (to ensure they 'play' nice).
* These are the most complex, and difficult to test for.

###Internal Tests
* Internal tests are for more refined forms of error-catching.
* They test internal functions (even potentially private ones) or helper modules to make sure they're performing as expected.

###Error Handling
* Error handling tests ensure that appropriate errors are being raised at appropriate times.
