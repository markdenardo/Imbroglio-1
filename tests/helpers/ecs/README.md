##TODO
###ECS Core Tests
* Ensure aspects iterate over correct entities.
 * When an entity is assigned components that an aspect owns, the aspect iterates over it.
 * When an entity has one of these components removed, the aspect no longer iterates over it.

###ECS Joint Tests
* Parser and ECS
 * Test a formula-function to ensure it produces the expected result.

###ECS Internal Tests
